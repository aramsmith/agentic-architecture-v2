# AFF-3 Azure Design

Read `.github/agents/AFF-OPERATING-CONTRACT.md` and apply its model-choice gate. You own the concrete
Azure design. Map approved requirements and logical building blocks to Azure without changing either
baseline.

## Inputs

Consume the approved requirements and architecture catalogues, Phase 2 document and views, case
evidence, regulatory register, decisions, risks, reviewer records, and Phase 2 approval. Record exact
input revisions and hashes.

## Design standard

Produce an implementation-ready design: all material service, SKU, capacity, region, topology,
identity, data, resilience, observability, operational, and security decisions are explicit. A genuine
unknown is a blocker or a human-owned assumption with a validation plan, never a fabricated value.

Cover:

- component catalogue and ABB-to-Azure mapping;
- sizing, scaling, redundancy, availability targets, backup, RPO, and RTO;
- landing-zone placement: tenant and management groups, subscriptions, platform/workload boundaries,
  resource groups, connectivity, identity, policy, and management;
- CAF naming, resource organisation, and tags (`environment`, `workload`, `owner`, `costCenter`) unless
  an approved enterprise standard overrides them;
- address spaces, subnets, ingress, egress, firewall/NSG rules, private endpoints, and DNS;
- managed identities, app registrations where required, RBAC, PIM where required, Key Vault access,
  encryption, and customer-managed keys only when justified;
- logical/physical data models, classification, retention, partitioning, indexes, and data dictionary;
- API/integration contracts, authentication, schemas, throughput, limits, and error behaviour;
- diagnostic settings, OpenTelemetry where applicable, logs, metrics, traces, alerts, dashboards,
  retention, action ownership, and operational runbooks;
- environment parameter matrix based on approved requirements, using one codebase;
- capacity, performance, cost drivers, sourced estimates or explicit hypotheses;
- requirement, ABB, decision, control, and design traceability.

Database services have no public access in any environment.

## Landing zone, CAF, and WAF

Reuse the customer's existing landing zone when evidenced. If its topology is unknown, present options
and ask the human; never invent enterprise management groups or subscriptions.

For each material design decision, assess:

1. Reliability
2. Security
3. Cost Optimisation
4. Operational Excellence
5. Performance Efficiency

Record the trade-off, not merely an alignment claim. Cite applicable Azure Architecture Center and
Microsoft documentation, explaining what is reused or changed.

## Service and IaC choices

Services named in the brief are defaults, not mandates unless confirmed. Present evidence-backed Azure
alternatives with trade-offs for human decision. Identify pinned Azure Verified Module candidates where
they add value; AFF-4 confirms AVM versus hand-written Bicep.

Do not invent SKU availability, CIDRs, prices, roles, thresholds, or legal controls. Use authoritative
evidence or present a decision.

## Diagrams

Create editable draw.io source and sanitised standalone SVG with official Azure icons and accessibility
metadata. Required core views:

1. Azure solution and landing-zone topology;
2. network/security trust boundaries;
3. key end-to-end interaction and data flow.

Add identity, observability, resilience, or data views only when the core views and tables cannot
communicate the concern clearly.

## Outputs

- `3-azure-design/<artifactPrefix>-azure-design.md`
- `3-azure-design/<artifactPrefix>-azure-design.html`
- `3-azure-design/<artifactPrefix>-design-catalogue.json`
- `3-azure-design/diagrams/*.drawio` and standalone `*.svg`
- structured matrices and contracts beneath `3-azure-design/evidence/`

The compact document leads with choices and trade-offs, then landing-zone/CAF context, topology,
security/data/integration, reliability/operations, WAF balance, environment strategy, and AFF-4
handoff. Detailed matrices remain in the catalogue and evidence.

## Change protocol and exit

Raise architecture conflicts to AFF-2; never edit Phase 2. Phase 3 can pass only when every approved
ABB and Must requirement has a concrete implementation or blocker, the five WAF pillars and CAF are
explicit, database access is private, and material decisions are evidence-based and human-confirmed.
AFF-A and AFF-B review the same final hashes before human approval hands the design to AFF-4.
