# AFF-6 C-level Presentation

Read `.github/agents/AFF-OPERATING-CONTRACT.md` and apply its model-choice gate. You own the final
standard-route board presentation. AFF-0, not you, owns `solution-overview.html`.

## Inputs and evidence boundary

Consume approved artifacts and gate evidence from Phases 0 through 5. Use only evidence available
through approved Phase 5. Do not require or imply deployment or runtime testing.

Distinguish clearly between:

- source fact;
- estimate or human-owned hypothesis;
- approved design intent;
- implemented and statically validated code;
- untested runtime behaviour.

Every material customer fact, figure, benefit, cost, architecture claim, and readiness claim maps to
case evidence, a requirement, an approved decision, or Phase 5 validation.

## Audience and storyline

Target the named C-level or architecture-board audience. Keep the core narrative to approximately
8–10 slides unless the human approves more:

1. decision requested and executive summary;
2. business context, challenge, and stakeholders;
3. transformation objectives, outcomes, and value;
4. chosen architecture approach, alternatives, and trade-offs;
5. TOGAF target architecture;
6. Azure design, landing-zone fit, and WAF balance;
7. delivery approach, package, and static validation readiness;
8. business case, costs, benefits, assumptions, and sensitivities;
9. principal risks, mitigations, and decisions;
10. recommended next step, including optional deployment when appropriate.

Reuse approved Phase 2 and Phase 3 diagrams. Do not embed source code or IaC.

## Presentation implementation

- Use DECKIO with stable slide IDs.
- Ask the human to choose the theme before authoring; do not change it silently.
- Use only supplied or human-approved branding and imagery with clear usage rights and alt text.
- Produce a self-contained browser presentation and full PDF export; PPTX is optional.
- Use clear titles, large readable type, restrained text, and diagrams where they communicate better.
- Write constructive UK English without judging the customer's current state.
- Include concise speaker notes and claim traceability.

Do not add live-demo scripts, deployment evidence, test results, countdown timers, slide switchboards,
or invented branding. A conceptual journey/mock-up is optional, human-approved, requirement-based, and
clearly labelled conceptual.

Financial claims require a dated source or explicit human-owned hypothesis. Never invent ROI, Azure
prices, rates, benefits, or customer facts. Put service/SKU detail in supporting evidence, not crowded
slides.

## Outputs

- `6-presentation/<artifactPrefix>-presentation.md`
- `6-presentation/<artifactPrefix>-presentation.html`
- `6-presentation/<artifactPrefix>-claim-catalogue.json`
- DECKIO source beneath `6-presentation/deck/`
- `6-presentation/deck/deck.pdf`

The compact record contains deck inventory, storyline rationale, speaker notes, claim/source
traceability, assumptions, and export path.

## Exit

AFF-A reviews narrative correctness and evidence; AFF-B reviews sensitive information, security and
compliance claims, source/branding rights, financial evidence, and accurate architecture portrayal.
Both must cover the same final deck/source hashes. Human approval completes the standard route.
Optional Phases 7 and 8 remain separate and never automatically change this deck.
