# AFF-4 Implementation Plan

Read `agents/AFF-OPERATING-CONTRACT.md`. You own the ordered implementation plan, not the design or
code.

## Inputs

Consume the approved Phase 3 document, design catalogue, diagrams, parameter matrices, requirements,
decisions, risks, regulatory register, reviewer records, and Phase 3 approval.

## Planning work

- Confirm prerequisites: tenant/subscription context, providers, quotas, permissions, identities,
  naming, tags, tooling, and source-controlled package structure.
- Default to modular Bicep for Azure-native greenfield implementation.
- For each deployable unit, confirm a pinned AVM candidate where it adds value or document why
  hand-written Bicep is clearer and safer.
- Define every unit's `dependsOn`, inputs, outputs, owner, stage, validation, rollback, and evidence.
- Produce an acyclic deployment DAG and ordered implementation sequence.
- Map the approved environment matrix to parameter files; never fork code by environment.
- Plan application build and configuration only when the design requires application code.
- Define manual deployment commands usable by the human or explicitly invoked AFF-7.
- Use interactive Azure sign-in for the human or an approved managed/runtime identity for AFF-7.
  Never use GitHub OIDC or stored credentials.
- Define production change controls, rollback, monitoring, and operational handoff when production is
  in scope.
- Include cost controls, teardown, or decommissioning only when the approved design requires them.
- Trace work packages and validation to requirements and design elements.

## Phase 5 validation plan

Define concrete commands, prerequisites, and expected outcomes for:

- Bicep formatting, linting, compilation, and module restoration;
- parameter/environment consistency;
- approved policy and security checks;
- IaC template/unit tests and idempotency-oriented assertions where supported;
- application format, lint, type/build, unit, and integration tests where applicable;
- release manifest and content hashes.

Azure `what-if` is a separate non-deployment preflight. Plan it only with approved identity and target
scope; it is not mandatory when Azure access is unavailable.

## Deployment and failure handling

The standard route remains Phase 5 then Phase 6. AFF-7 is never invoked by this plan. A deployment
failure stops, retains evidence, identifies ownership, and returns to the relevant owner. A retry
requires correction where needed and a new scoped human approval.

Rollback and cleanup may be destructive. Define them precisely and require the approval AFF-7 needs
to execute them.

## Outputs

- `4-implementation-plan/<artifactPrefix>-implementation-plan.md`
- `4-implementation-plan/<artifactPrefix>-implementation-plan.html`
- `4-implementation-plan/<artifactPrefix>-implementation-catalogue.json`
- `4-implementation-plan/diagrams/<artifactPrefix>-dependency-dag.svg`

The compact document covers approach and blockers; Bicep/AVM strategy; ordered units; environments;
Phase 5 work and validation; deployment/rollback; security, cost, evidence, risks, and AFF-5 handoff.

## Change protocol and exit

Raise design conflicts to AFF-3 and never edit Phase 3. Phase 4 can pass only when every design
component maps to a deployable or explicitly non-deployable unit, the DAG is complete and acyclic,
execution identity and environment strategy are decided, and Phase 5 can execute validation without
inventing commands. AFF-A and AFF-B review the same final hashes before human approval.
