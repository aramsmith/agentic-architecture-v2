# AFF-7 Optional Deployment

Read `agents/AFF-OPERATING-CONTRACT.md`. This phase is optional and human-invocable only after approved
Phase 6. You execute the exact AFF-5 procedure; you never author or repair code, IaC, parameters,
approvals, or upstream artifacts.

## Pre-execution authorisation

Do not execute any Azure command until the human explicitly authorises one attempt and records:

- tenant, subscription, resource group(s), environment, and material region;
- release-manifest/package hash and parameter-set hash;
- deployment procedure version;
- human-interactive identity or approved managed/runtime identity;
- permitted preflight, deployment, rollback, cleanup, and destructive operations;
- attempt identifier and time/change window.

Approval covers one attempt only. A retry, changed target, changed package, changed parameters, or
additional operation needs new approval. Do not use GitHub OIDC or stored credentials.

Production requires heightened confirmation of blast radius, backups/readiness, monitoring and
incident ownership, change window, rollback authority, and operational handoff.

## Execution

1. Verify approved Phase 6 completion and the Phase 5 package/review hashes.
2. Authenticate using only the approved method.
3. Confirm the active tenant/subscription and target resources match authorisation.
4. Run approved preflight and `what-if` steps. Stop on drift, scope mismatch, unexpected deletion or
   replacement, or a materially different plan.
5. Execute the exact approved deployment command.
6. Capture redacted command, timestamp, exit code, operations, outputs, and resource inventory.
7. Perform only basic deployment verification: provisioning state, expected resources, deployment
   outputs, basic health, and telemetry availability.

Functional, integration, security, resilience, performance, and acceptance testing belongs to AFF-8.

Never expose secrets, tokens, connection strings, personal data, or sensitive output. Rollback and
cleanup are potentially destructive and may run only when covered by the attempt authorisation or
separately approved.

## Failure handling

Stop on failure or unsafe divergence. Classify the issue as procedure, parameter, platform, permission,
design, or code related and route evidence to the correct owner. Do not silently correct or retry.
Changed code/IaC requires a new Phase 5 package, review, and approval.

Record one outcome:

- `SUCCEEDED`
- `FAILED`
- `STOPPED`
- `ROLLED_BACK`

Preserve every attempt; never overwrite failed evidence.

## Outputs

- `7-deployment/<artifactPrefix>-deployment-report.md`
- `7-deployment/<artifactPrefix>-deployment-report.html`
- `7-deployment/<artifactPrefix>-deployment-attempts.json`
- redacted evidence beneath `7-deployment/evidence/`

The compact report records authorisation, target/package binding, ordered execution, observed result,
rollback/cleanup, issue ownership, and residual risk.

## Final gate

Pre-execution authorisation is not final Phase 7 approval. AFF-A and AFF-B review the same final
evidence hashes after the attempt. The human then approves or rejects the Phase 7 result. Only a
`SUCCEEDED` attempt with completed reviews and final human approval is eligible for separately invoked
Phase 8. AFF-0 refreshes the overview; AFF-6 is not automatically rerun.
