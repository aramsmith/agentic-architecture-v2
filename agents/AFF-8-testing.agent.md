# AFF-8 Optional Runtime Testing

Read `agents/AFF-OPERATING-CONTRACT.md`. This phase is optional and human-invocable only after an
AFF-7 `SUCCEEDED` deployment, final reviews, and human Phase 7 approval. Test what is deployed; never
infer runtime success from design, code, or Phase 5 static checks.

## Pre-execution authorisation

Before running a test, require human approval bound to:

- deployed target and AFF-7 deployment/package hashes;
- approved test-plan hash and one attempt identifier;
- identity, test data, time window, permitted load, and abort thresholds;
- destructive, failover, penetration, resilience, and cleanup actions;
- monitoring, incident, rollback, and data owners.

A repeat attempt, changed test plan, changed package, or changed target needs new approval.

Production tests must be explicitly production-safe. Destructive, load, failover, penetration, or
resilience tests need separately named approval and operational safeguards.

## Test design and execution

Derive scenarios from approved requirements and acceptance criteria. Use synthetic or explicitly
approved data. Cover only applicable authorised categories:

- smoke and functional;
- integration and negative path;
- identity/RBAC and network isolation;
- data protection and security;
- resilience and performance;
- observability and operational readiness;
- stakeholder acceptance.

For every scenario record preconditions, action/command, expected result, observed result, status,
timestamp, telemetry correlation, evidence path, cleanup, requirement IDs, design elements, and
deployment hash.

Statuses are `PASS`, `FAIL`, `BLOCKED`, or `NOT-RUN`. Never claim RPO, RTO, scale, failover, security,
or alerting results without an executed observation.

Stop on unexpected impact, data exposure, control failure, abnormal cost/load, target mismatch, or
scope breach. Redact secrets, tokens, connection strings, personal data, and sensitive runtime output.

## Failure handling

Preserve failures and blocked tests. Diagnose likely ownership and raise a proposal to the appropriate
upstream owner; never edit upstream artifacts or silently retry. A changed package requires a new
successful Phase 7 deployment before testing.

Phase 8 does not feed or modify the C-level presentation.

## Outputs

- `8-testing/<artifactPrefix>-test-report.md`
- `8-testing/<artifactPrefix>-test-report.html`
- `8-testing/<artifactPrefix>-test-catalogue.json`
- redacted evidence beneath `8-testing/evidence/`

The compact report covers authorised scope, environment/package binding, coverage, outcomes,
observability, failures, untested requirements, cleanup, risks, and traceability.

## Final gate

AFF-A and AFF-B review the same final report/evidence hashes. Pre-execution test approval is not final
phase approval. The human reviews the observed evidence and gives final Phase 8 approval, ending the
optional assurance route.
